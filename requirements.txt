# Requirements for SHA-256 Implementation and Analysis
# This file specifies the Python packages needed to run the complete implementation

# ============================================================================
# CORE DEPENDENCIES (Required)
# ============================================================================

# NumPy - Essential for 32-bit integer arithmetic
# SHA-256 requires precise 32-bit modular arithmetic operations
numpy>=1.19.0,<2.0.0

# Jupyter - Interactive notebook environment
# Required for running the main implementation (problems.ipynb)
jupyter>=1.0.0
notebook>=6.0.0

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES (Enhanced functionality)
# ============================================================================

# JupyterLab - Modern interface (alternative to classic notebook)
jupyterlab>=3.0.0

# NBConvert - Notebook conversion tools (included with jupyter)
nbconvert>=6.0.0

# Argon2 Password Hashing - State-of-the-art secure password storage
# Winner of Password Hashing Competition, used in Problem 5 security demonstrations
# Optional: code gracefully handles absence with try/except ImportError
argon2-cffi>=21.0.0

# ============================================================================
# PYTHON STANDARD LIBRARY (No installation needed)
# ============================================================================
# The following modules are built into Python:
# - itertools (combinatorial functions for password enumeration)
# - string (character set definitions: ascii_lowercase, digits, etc.)
# - time (performance measurement and timing)
# - hashlib (only used for verification, not core implementation)
