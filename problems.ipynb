    "### Block Parse Generator Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `block_parse` generator function implements the [FIPS 180-4 message parsing and padding algorithm](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) with the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Highlights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Memory-Efficient Processing:**\n",
    "- Uses [Python's generator pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators) to process large messages without loading entire content into memory\n",
    "- Yields 512-bit blocks on-demand, enabling streaming hash computation\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. FIPS 180-4 Compliance:**\n",
    "- **[Section 5.1.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)**: Implements mandatory padding with '1' bit + zero bits + 64-bit length\n",
    "- **[Section 5.2.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)**: Parses padded message into exactly 512-bit blocks\n",
    "- Ensures deterministic padding for cryptographic security\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Padding Algorithm:**\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Append mandatory '1' bit (0x80 byte)\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Calculate and append zero padding to reach l + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512)\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Append original message length as 64-bit big-endian integer\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Edge Case Handling:**\n",
    "- **Empty messages**: Properly padded to one complete block\n",
    "- **Boundary conditions**: 55-byte vs 56-byte messages handled differently\n",
    "- **Large messages**: Efficient processing without memory constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation ensures complete [SHA-256 standard compliance](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) while providing optimal performance for both small and large message inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mathematical Foundation and Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding algorithm follows the [mathematical requirement](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) that for a message of length l bits:\n",
    "**l + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512)**, where k ≥ 0 is the number of zero bits added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: \"abc\" message (24 bits)**\n",
    "- Original: `616263` (3 bytes = 24 bits)\n",
    "- Add '1' bit: `61626380` (mandatory padding bit)\n",
    "- Calculate k: 24 + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512) → k = 423 bits = 52.875 bytes → 52 zero bytes\n",
    "- Add zeros: `61626380` + 52 zero bytes\n",
    "- Add length: final 8 bytes = `0000000000000018` (24 in big-endian)\n",
    "- Result: Single 512-bit block with proper alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: 56-byte message (448 bits)**\n",
    "- After adding '1' bit: 448 + 1 = 449 bits\n",
    "- Space remaining in first block: 512 - 449 = 63 bits (< 64 bits needed for length)\n",
    "- Solution: Zero-pad to complete first block, use entire second block for length\n",
    "- Result: Two 512-bit blocks (critical boundary case)\n",

    "- The [64-bit length field](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) prevents attackers from appending data to create valid hashes\n",
    "- Without proper padding, an attacker could extend `hash(M)` to `hash(M||M')` without knowing M\n",

    "**2. Merkle-Damgård Construction Compliance:**\n",
    "- SHA-256 uses the [Merkle-Damgård paradigm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48184-2_32) requiring unambiguous message parsing\n",

    "- Represents the internal state that gets transformed during compression\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Compression Rounds (Step 3):**\n",
    "- **64 rounds** of nonlinear transformations using:\n",
    "  - **T1 = h + Σ₁(e) + Ch(e,f,g) + K_t + W_t**: Primary transformation\n",
    "  - **T2 = Σ₀(a) + Maj(a,b,c)**: Secondary transformation  \n",

    "- **H^(i) = H^(i-1) + compressed_state**: Adds working variables to previous hash\n",
    "- Ensures each block's influence accumulates in the final hash value\n",

    "**1. Avalanche Effect:**\n",
    "- Small changes in input block cause dramatic changes in output hash\n",
    "- Achieved through nonlinear functions and complex bit dependencies\n",

    "**2. Collision Resistance:**\n",
    "- 64 rounds of mixing make it computationally infeasible to find collisions\n",
    "- Each round introduces unique mathematical transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preimage Resistance:**\n",
    "- One-way property: easy to compute hash from message, hard to reverse\n",

    "1. **Message Parsing** (Problem 3): Converts arbitrary messages to 512-bit blocks\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Functions** (Problem 1): Provides nonlinear transformations\n",
    "3. **Round Constants** (Problem 2): Ensures unique influence per round\n",
    "4. **Initial Hash Values**: H₀ through H₇ (typically [square roots of first 8 primes](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **FIPS 180-4 Compliance:**\n",

    "### Compression Function Testing and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `test_hash_compression()` function provides **comprehensive validation** of the SHA-256 compression function implementation against established [FIPS 180-4 test vectors](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) and cryptographic standards. This testing framework ensures both correctness and compliance with official specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Vector Validation Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Official NIST Test Cases:**\n",
    "- **Empty Message Test**: Validates the baseline case with only padding\n",
    "- **\"abc\" Message Test**: Standard three-character test from [FIPS 180-4 Appendix A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)\n",
    "- **Multi-Block Test**: Verifies proper state propagation across block boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Hash Chain Verification:**\n",
    "- Tests sequential application: H^(i) = compression(H^(i-1), M^(i))  \n",
    "- Ensures proper state accumulation across multiple 512-bit blocks\n",
    "- Validates iterative hash computation as specified in [Section 6.2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cryptographic Test Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Deterministic Output Verification:**\n",
    "- **Empty message**: `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`\n",
    "- **\"abc\" message**: `ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad`\n",
    "- Results must match [official NIST test vectors](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/sha_testvectors.html) exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Avalanche Effect Demonstration:**\n",
    "- Single bit changes in input produce drastically different outputs\n",
    "- Validates non-linear transformation properties of compression rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Integration Testing:**\n",
    "- **Message Parsing**: Uses `block_parse()` from Problem 3 for proper padding\n",
    "- **Auxiliary Functions**: Exercises all Problem 1 functions (Ch, Maj, Σ, σ)\n",
    "- **Round Constants**: Validates Problem 2 constants K₀ through K₆₃\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Verification Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initial Hash Values (H⁰):**\n",

    "- **ISO/IEC 10118-3**: International hash function standard\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Output Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results:**\n",
    "- **Match indicators** confirm bit-exact compliance with standards\n",
    "- **Runtime warnings** are expected due to intentional 32-bit arithmetic overflow\n",
    "- **Multiple blocks** demonstrate proper state chaining through compression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Hash mismatches** indicate implementation errors requiring investigation\n",
    "- **Exception handling** validates proper input validation and error conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive testing framework ensures the compression function meets **production-grade cryptographic requirements** suitable for digital signatures, blockchain applications, and secure hash computation as specified in [FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).\n",
