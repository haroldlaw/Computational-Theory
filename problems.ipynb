    "### Block Parse Generator Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `block_parse` generator function implements the [FIPS 180-4 message parsing and padding algorithm](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) with the following key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Highlights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Memory-Efficient Processing:**\n",
    "- Uses [Python's generator pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators) to process large messages without loading entire content into memory\n",
    "- Yields 512-bit blocks on-demand, enabling streaming hash computation\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. FIPS 180-4 Compliance:**\n",
    "- **[Section 5.1.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)**: Implements mandatory padding with '1' bit + zero bits + 64-bit length\n",
    "- **[Section 5.2.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)**: Parses padded message into exactly 512-bit blocks\n",
    "- Ensures deterministic padding for cryptographic security\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Padding Algorithm:**\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Append mandatory '1' bit (0x80 byte)\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Calculate and append zero padding to reach l + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512)\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Append original message length as 64-bit big-endian integer\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Edge Case Handling:**\n",
    "- **Empty messages**: Properly padded to one complete block\n",
    "- **Boundary conditions**: 55-byte vs 56-byte messages handled differently\n",
    "- **Large messages**: Efficient processing without memory constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation ensures complete [SHA-256 standard compliance](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) while providing optimal performance for both small and large message inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mathematical Foundation and Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding algorithm follows the [mathematical requirement](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) that for a message of length l bits:\n",
    "**l + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512)**, where k ≥ 0 is the number of zero bits added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: \"abc\" message (24 bits)**\n",
    "- Original: `616263` (3 bytes = 24 bits)\n",
    "- Add '1' bit: `61626380` (mandatory padding bit)\n",
    "- Calculate k: 24 + 1 + k ≡ 448 (mod 512) → k = 423 bits = 52.875 bytes → 52 zero bytes\n",
    "- Add zeros: `61626380` + 52 zero bytes\n",
    "- Add length: final 8 bytes = `0000000000000018` (24 in big-endian)\n",
    "- Result: Single 512-bit block with proper alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: 56-byte message (448 bits)**\n",
    "- After adding '1' bit: 448 + 1 = 449 bits\n",
    "- Space remaining in first block: 512 - 449 = 63 bits (< 64 bits needed for length)\n",
    "- Solution: Zero-pad to complete first block, use entire second block for length\n",
    "- Result: Two 512-bit blocks (critical boundary case)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cryptographic Security Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper message padding is essential for cryptographic security:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Length Extension Attack Prevention:**\n",
    "- The [64-bit length field](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) prevents attackers from appending data to create valid hashes\n",
    "- Without proper padding, an attacker could extend `hash(M)` to `hash(M||M')` without knowing M\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Merkle-Damgård Construction Compliance:**\n",
    "- SHA-256 uses the [Merkle-Damgård paradigm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48184-2_32) requiring unambiguous message parsing\n",
    "- Improper padding could lead to collision vulnerabilities or preimage attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Deterministic Processing:**\n",
    "- Same message always produces identical padding, ensuring hash consistency\n",
    "- Critical for digital signatures and cryptographic protocols requiring reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Integration with SHA-256 Hash Computation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `block_parse` function serves as the **preprocessing stage** in the complete [SHA-256 pipeline](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Message Parsing** (this function): Convert arbitrary-length input to 512-bit blocks\n",
    "2. **Message Schedule**: Expand each block to 64 words using σ₀ and σ₁ functions\n",
    "3. **Compression**: Apply Ch, Maj, Σ₀, Σ₁ functions for 64 rounds per block\n",
    "4. **Output**: Produce final 256-bit hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parsed block becomes input to the compression function, making proper padding critical for the entire hash computation's security and correctness as detailed in the [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation follows all requirements specified in [NIST FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) and is compatible with [RFC 6234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234) implementation guidelines."

    "#### **Test Case Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Boundary Condition Testing:**\n",
    "- **Empty message (0 bytes)**: Validates minimal padding scenario\n",
    "- **55-byte message**: Tests maximum single-block capacity  \n",
    "- **56-byte message**: Forces two-block requirement due to length field\n",
    "- **64-byte message**: Tests exact block boundary behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Validation Methodology:**\n",
    "- **Block size verification**: Ensures each block is exactly 512 bits (64 bytes)\n",
    "- **Length field validation**: Confirms final 8 bytes encode original message length\n",
    "- **Padding structure analysis**: Displays final block in hexadecimal for manual verification\n",
    "- **Error detection**: Identifies any implementation discrepancies\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. FIPS 180-4 Compliance Verification:**\n",
    "- **Deterministic output**: Same input always produces identical blocks\n",
    "- **Standard conformance**: Validates against [official SHA-256 specification](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensures consistent behavior across systems\n",

    "- Final block: 120-128 = -8 bytes → requires padding in third block\n",
    "- Validates scalability for large messages\n",

    "- **Completeness**: All message lengths produce valid padded output\n",
    "- **Determinism**: Identical inputs always produce identical padding\n",

    "### SHA-256 Hash Compression Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash(current, block)` function implements the **SHA-256 compression function** as specified in the [FIPS 180-4 Section 6.2.2 specification](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf). This is the core computational component that processes each 512-bit message block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Message Schedule Generation (Steps 1):**\n",
    "- **W₀ to W₁₅**: Direct copy from 512-bit message block in big-endian format\n",
    "- **W₁₆ to W₆₃**: Calculated using the [message schedule formula](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) W_t = σ₁(W_{t-2}) + W_{t-7} + σ₀(W_{t-15}) + W_{t-16}\n",
    "- Uses σ₀ and σ₁ functions from Problem 1 for optimal bit diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Working Variable Initialization (Step 2):**\n",
    "- Eight 32-bit variables (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) initialized with current hash state\n",
    "- Represents the internal state that gets transformed during compression\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Compression Rounds (Step 3):**\n",
    "- **64 rounds** of nonlinear transformations using:\n",
    "  - **T1 = h + Σ₁(e) + Ch(e,f,g) + K_t + W_t**: Primary transformation\n",
    "  - **T2 = Σ₀(a) + Maj(a,b,c)**: Secondary transformation  \n",
    "- Uses Σ₀, Σ₁, Ch, and Maj functions from Problem 1\n",
    "- Incorporates the [round constants K_t](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) from Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Hash State Update (Step 4):**\n",
    "- **H^(i) = H^(i-1) + compressed_state**: Adds working variables to previous hash\n",
    "- Ensures each block's influence accumulates in the final hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cryptographic Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Avalanche Effect:**\n",
    "- Small changes in input block cause dramatic changes in output hash\n",
    "- Achieved through nonlinear functions and complex bit dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Collision Resistance:**\n",
    "- 64 rounds of mixing make it computationally infeasible to find collisions\n",
    "- Each round introduces unique mathematical transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preimage Resistance:**\n",
    "- One-way property: easy to compute hash from message, hard to reverse\n",
    "- Nonlinear functions and modular arithmetic prevent inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Integration with Complete SHA-256:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The compression function works with other components:\n",
    "1. **Message Parsing** (Problem 3): Converts arbitrary messages to 512-bit blocks\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Functions** (Problem 1): Provides nonlinear transformations\n",
    "3. **Round Constants** (Problem 2): Ensures unique influence per round\n",
    "4. **Initial Hash Values**: H₀ through H₇ (typically [square roots of first 8 primes](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **FIPS 180-4 Compliance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every implementation detail follows the [official SHA-256 specification](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf):\n",
    "- **Bit ordering**: Big-endian throughout for cross-platform compatibility\n",
    "- **Modular arithmetic**: All operations performed modulo 2³²\n",
    "- **Round structure**: Exactly 64 rounds with specified transformations\n",
    "- **State mixing**: Precise working variable updates per specification\n",
    "\n",
    "This compression function forms the cryptographic heart of SHA-256, providing the security properties essential for digital signatures, blockchain systems, and data integrity verification as detailed in [NIST SP 800-107](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-107/rev-1/final).\n"
